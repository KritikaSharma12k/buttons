# buttons
This project is a simple button group built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It lets you generate a set of buttons and highlight the one thatâ€™s selected. Only one button can be active at a time, similar to a radio group. The design is clean, lightweight, and easy to customize for any UI.
